Search monolayer in blood smears


# Short description
In medical clinical diagnostics, a sample of white blood cells is collected in the thin part of the smear.This program is aimed at creating an algorithm for detecting monolayer on blood smears.  

First, a map of the entire mask is made at a small magnification of 10x

Then the analysis of the drug maps is performed, followed by the detection of a thin part.     


In the detected thin part, a sample of leukocytes can be collected.

This technique is well suited when using automated microscopic platforms.
